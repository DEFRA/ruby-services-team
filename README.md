# Ruby Services team

A team of awesome furicorns 🦄 dedicated to supporting and improving all Defra digital services built using *Ruby* ❤️ ('cos it's the best)!

This acts as a repo of guides and documents specific to the team, plus its where we manage our master list of issues rather than trying to manage them in individual projects.
