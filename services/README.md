# Services

Unlike most digital teams in Defra, the **Ruby services team** maintains multiple digital services. As such there is information on each, currently in a range of places. Where we can, we're trying to collate that info here so new members only need to refer to one place. But this is still a work in progress!

- [Register or renew as a waste carrier, broker or dealer](/services/wcr)
