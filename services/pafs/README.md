# Project Application and Funding Service

The Project Application and Funding Service (PAFS) is used by risk management authorities (RMA) to apply for funding for flood and coastal risk management projects.

(Pafs-admin)[https://github.com/DEFRA/pafs-admin]
(Pafs_core)[https://github.com/DEFRA/pafs_core]

Pafs-user is the front office application for users to submit thheir project proposals
